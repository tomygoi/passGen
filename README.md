# passGen

##Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This challenge presented an interface for a password generator and our task was to code the generator in javascript. The overall goal of this challenge was to create an effective password generator that would provide completely random passwords that match the user’s criteria. The work involved in this challenge would improve upon understanding how javascript can further enhance a webpage’s capabilities.
